<h1> Holaaa</h1>
<br>
<p> My name is Gia Castro. I am a rising junior who goes to SOF in manhattan by Gramercy Park. During my free time I enjoy editing, hanging out with friends, going out to eat with my family and shopping. My favorite subject in school is probably english or gym time, I enjoy english mostly because I get to express my inner thoughts through writing and I get to learn more about the real world through literature and writing and discussing work from other artists with my peers. As a person I see myself as a strong and confident young woman, and each day I push myself to be the best possible person I can be. I can be very social but at the same time I like to keep to myself.
